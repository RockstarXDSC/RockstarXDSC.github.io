            <h2 style="text-align:center">About the Event</h2>
            <p style="text-align:center">Since its inception in 2020, the Data Science Club at NYU has been committed to providing opportunities for the student body. Our Datathon is one of our capstone events, bringing together over 100 students to work with unique datasets and apply their skills to real world problems. This year, we have the honor of working with Rockstar Games, one of the biggest gaming companies in the world. Known for their world renowned titles such as Grand Theft Auto, Max Payne, L.A. Noire, The Warriors, Bully, Manhunt, Midnight Club, State of Emergency, and Red Dead, we look forward to the challenges they will bring to the table!</p>

            <h2 style="text-align:center">Missions (PLEASE PICK ONE)</h2>
            <h4 style="text-align:center">About the Dataset</h4>
            <p style="text-align:center">Grand Theft Auto a dynamic and ever-evolving universe in which they could play solo or with friends. Throughout the years the online game expanded to an even more massive online world where (almost) everything is possible. From curated activities to user generated content and free roam activities, there are endless possibilities in game to engage with. This variety in gameplay has attracted a wide array of players and satisfied different interests.

              <br>As players progress through the game, data points are captured about their experience. Using the terabytes of data and hundreds of telemetry metrics the game captures, we have generated a sample of game data. This sample, composed of CSV files, represents thousands of players and features millions of rows of information and tens of columns of gameplay variables. You'll have access to a 3-month period of player data to discover if any patterns emerge.
              
               </p>
            <h4 style="text-align:center">The World is at your Fingertips: Sandbox Challenge</h4>
            <p style="text-align:center">With this dataset, it is possible to gain insights into the activities players have participated in and their outcomes. You'll have the opportunity to marry this data with information related to overall engagement in the online game, such as time spent engaging in the overall world itself. Players can also purchase items with in-game currency as they progress through the experience. Some of the data presented here relates to choices made by players as to how they spend their GTA$ as they move through the world. Rockstar is looking to find actionable, clear, and valuable insights from this data. The delivery of the insights will be in a presentation format; visuals and storytelling will be key. Making a persuasive, supported case for your analysis is important; the quality of questions raised, and answers given will split great presentations from the best. Adding extra insights about improving our data or future questions to dig into will gain extra points.</p>
            
            <h4 style="text-align:center">What Kind of Gamer are You?: Cluster Segmentation and Machine Learning</h4>
            
            <p style="text-align:center">            GTA Online is designed for players of all kinds, from those looking to build a criminal empire by taking on a business to co-operative players with a taste for Heists, or those who compete head-to-head with other players in structured modes and much more. Do you spend your time racing? Or do you prefer showing off your car at the car meet? What about playing at the casino or being your own boss? How do you play GTA Online? What are the characteristics that define you as a gamer? Is anyone out there like you?
              <br>Rockstar is looking to understand our player base and segment it in a way that is actionable, clear, and valuable to our business. Shared solutions are thoughtful, memorable, and innovative. Adding extra insights about improving our data or future questions to dig into will gain extra points.
              <br>With that criteria in mind, the delivery of the solution will be a presentation and the code for the solution; visuals and conciseness are expected. Model performance, outlier management, and training runtime should be shared. For extra points, cleanliness of code will be taken into account.</p>
            <h4 style="text-align:center">Teamwork Makes the Dream Work: Show off your team spirit!</h4>
            <p style="text-align:center">Share your team spirit throughout the event by completing our social activities via Slack/Instagram! We want to see how you're engaging with the event so tag us on your social media platforms (@dscnyu)!</p>
